# MIPS_Simulator
MIPS Simulator by Using Java
This is a course project to implement a MIPS 32 simulator. It contains two functional parts. The first is to convert input binary file into instructions that can be executed. The second part is to simulate how MIPS 32 works by using Tomasulo algorithm with branch prediction. The output file is printed in cycle-by-cycle fashion.
